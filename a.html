  “Bangladesh can take pride in the kind of national awareness and planning as well as international advocacy that it has invested in tackling this problem for the last seven years.

“It has become evident that mass awareness, backed by political will, can make a difference in the lives of those with autism and other challenges,” she said in her keynote speech at a panel discussion at the UN in New York on Friday.

The event, co-hosted by the UN missions of Bangladesh and Qatar and Autism Speaks and co-sponsored by the missions of India, South Korea and the US, was organised to mark this year’s World Autism Awareness Day observed on Saturday.

However, Hossain, a member of the World Health Organisation’s Expert Advisory Panel on Mental Health, noted that Bangladesh still faced ‘significant challenges’ despite its ‘innovative approach and international leadership in the area of tackling autism’.

She said Bangladesh was also working with the WHO to provide a template for a global strategy to address the neurodevelopment disorder (NDD) in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

“We take our international commitments very seriously.”

Better known in Bangladesh by her nickname, Putul, the daughter of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told the UN panel discussion that the Bangladesh government had as part of its plans the inclusion and integration of those with autism in national development efforts.

“It has been made mandatory for all early childhood centres to include at least two children with disabilities each. The Ministry of Education has also set up a National Autism and NDD Academy.”

“The National Theatre has taken a decision to allow and encourage youth with autism to participate in their regular productions.”



At the beginning of her 12-minute speech, Putul, who also chairs the National Advisory Committee on Autism and Neurodevelopment Disorders, spoke of Sheikh Hasina’s commitment in ensuring the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities.
'Don’t just call anyone autistic'

In a video message beamed to a programme marking World Autism Awareness Day in Dhaka, Putul said not all those with physical or psychological impairment should be called autistic.

“The term ‘autism’ has become so familiar that we use it indiscriminately. I request you not to call anyone autistic that easily.”

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina attended the event organised at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on Saturday morning.

Elaborating on the nature of autism, Putul said, “It is a complex neurological development disorder. It affects not only the individual but the entire family as well.”

The autistic should be included in the development process so that “they can consider themselves part of our country, so that they do not feel themselves left out,” she went on.

Fourteen ministries in Bangladesh are working in the national steering committee to improve the situation for the autistic, said Putul.

“Quick detection, treatment, social treatment, learning in schools, vocational training -- we are thinking about everything … We are advancing step by step.

Different countries adopt different measures to treat the autistic and “we have taken a new approach in our country,” she said.

"We observe this day in Bangladesh on a big scale, unlike most other countries. We are very proud of this."
